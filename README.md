This is a *Java H2 Database Car Sharing* project that I made myself.

<p>Car-sharing is becoming a more and more popular green alternative to owning a car.Â This is a program that manages a car-sharing service allowing companies to rent out their cars and find customers. I used H2 database to store the Company, Car, Customer data. I connected to the database using JDBC driver and Connection objects. Wrote the queries in SQL to Create, Read, Update and Delete the tables.</p>
